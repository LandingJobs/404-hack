# Objective

Weâ€™d like to involve Landing.jobs community in building a new 404 page to [Landing.jobs](https://landing.jobs). They say that our current one is boring and has no interaction, and they are right! Our current page is [https://landing.jobs/404.html](https://landing.jobs/404.html).

# How it will work

First of all, we need ideas. If you have any ideas, go to [this issue](https://github.com/LandingJobs/404-hack/issues/1) and give your thoughts. The most awesome ideas will be implemented and published as our 404 page. You can also attach image mocks.

# Requirements

The page has to be an static HTML page and run on Internet Explorer 10+, Firefox 40+, Chrome 45+, Safari 8+ on Windows, Mac and Linux.
